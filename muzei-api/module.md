# Module muzei-api

Muzei offers two API surfaces:

1. A content provider contract that allows you to read current artwork data. This is the focus of
 the [com.google.android.apps.muzei.api] package.

2. A simple API that allows you to build your own wallpaper source via the classes in the
 [com.google.android.apps.muzei.api.provider] package.
